# Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to use unsupervised learning to process, cluster, and visualize cryptocurrency data.

# Methodology
Using Jupyter Notebook and Python Pandas, I imported the source data file (crypto_data.csv) and began preprocessing. Upon completion, I reduced data dimensions using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and moved forward with 3 principal components. Next came clustering the data using the K-means algorithm, and finally a series of visualizations using Plotly Express and hvplot: a 3D scatter plot, a table, and finally a 2D scatter plot.  

# Results
Please review the [crypto_clustering](crypto_clustering.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook file and run the code to view all visualizations!
